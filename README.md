## Implementation of classic Triango strategy game for Mini Micro

This is a project to resurrect a strategy game invented in the 1980s called [_Triango_](https://www.metacritic.com/game/triango/).  It's loosely inspired by [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), one of the most popular board games in the world, but it's played on a hexagonal grid, and you capture by forming perfect triangles that contain your opponent's stones.  The game is over when only one player is able to move.

There are a couple gameplay videos you can check out here, though neither of the people making these videos bothered to read the rules to figure out how to play:

The best implementation of this, from what I've been able to find, was for the Apple IIGS.  It had amazing sound and (for the time) graphics, and was truly a thing of beauty.  The versions on other computers (even the Amiga) were not nearly as nice, and nothing like it exists today.

Time to change that!

I'm recreating it in [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/), a free retro-style virtual computer.  It's got the graphics and sound capabilities to truly bring this game to life.
